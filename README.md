SFCC Cartridge Overrides VS Code Extension

## This Extension is a Work in Progress

Extension Development

> Before this extension is available in the VS Code Marketplace, you can test it manually:

1. Open File `extension.code-workspace` in VS Code
2. Run `npm install` in VS Code Terminal
3. Press `F5` to test extension in a new VS Code window

NOTE: The first time you press `F5` it may launch in an empty workspace. You will likely need to open your SFCC project into this new VS Code window.
